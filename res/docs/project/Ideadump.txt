___A

Aerospace
A map one level above the Sector terrain. Costs to control. Easy to lose. Adds another layer to strategic game.

Accessibility
Zecurfoez is an accessible game, inclusive to people with reduced vision.
- Large fonts (16pt/92dpi), clear bold graphics and menus.
- W3 WCAG 2.1.
- Custom Color Picker Player, Follower/Ally, Hostile Unit halo.
- https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/
- Subtitles for hearing impaired/deaf.


___B

Basic Universal Force: Entropy #simulation #gameplay #entropy
- add noise to signals: Noise Probability Modifier = in practice a low chance of signal being lost.
- effects commands, radar updates and meeting invitation = doesn't reach player or target.
- has a chance of giving static feedback (a “hiccup”), so the player knows what has occurred.
- high solar activity count from sim multiplies Noise Probability Modifier (NPM).


___C

Charming test #socialdynamics #gameplay
Unit can gain followers by Charming other units. Player can lose followers to Commanders and Unit Followers they invite or ally.

Chess
Zecurfoez is the RTS-equivalent of chess on a 40x40 sector board.

Commander
Every faction has one commander, who has Allies or Followers. Commander is an Unit object,
but commanders actions must be determined manually.

Commander Video Meeting CVM
- Commander can request allied/follower units into video meeting to set their Unit Follower Policy UFP.
- CVM happens in one turn, and is subject to noise, equal to NPM. If NPM test not passed, the target of the invitation will not arrive to meeting, in effect the Commander cannot set their UFP.
- CVM starts with invitee board&table, and a dialog to set UFP for target invitees. Invitees then set Charming test on every other invitee - followers can be lost to invitees.

Commander Alliance #allies
Commander Units can request a CVM with other Commander Units to vote on/vote down Alliance. The Commanders that agree, will join Alliance = can share sight, cannot attack each other.

Contributors are identified per contributions in repository master.


___D

baribal> Documentation goes into your repo, and readthedocs will autogenerate a web page for it.

Debts
Code and features are debt, and require maintenance and updating. Any and all
effort must initially focus on simplifying the features and implementation.


___E

Earth Planet Sphere EPS is the planet simulation representation
- can be a simple 40x40 sector grid.
- see Hexagonal Planet Sphere, Triangular

EPS-Server
Actual instance of the running planet simulation.


___F

Fauna
Biosphere animal and plant life. These units are invisible on map, but do stuff (actions), and the Sub-sector natural resources equal their Power-structure.

Followers - see Unit Followers

___G

Game Genre #strategy #simulation #multiplayer
- Real Time Strategy in simulated Earth environment.
- Or Turn Based, Re: Chess

Game Authentication Server
- for Client session keys

Game Engine Server
Where game instances run whenever a game round starts.
- Connected to GAS for access-control.
- runs Sector physics effects instance requested from EPS
- runs Game Instance Indices and indice-sanity-checker (BB) (Index DB).
- History Index: previous games "bones files" from Power-structures.

Game Client
A (browser) client for logging players into the Zecurfoez Game Server, browsing & joining
Game Lobbies.

Game Instance
- A one multiplayer game, running in a Game Engine Server.
- Maintains game instance state: index of players and game units, and their move-vectors (spatial or logical moves).
- Runs periodic BB-checks on all units to ensure clients are not cheating.
- Shares (some of) the game instances state with clients.

Graphic Design
Graphic style is "Laser Radar Scan Line": 2D-reconstruction of horizontally scanning laser beam. As in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar.
- See Orange for theme color.
- Bold and clear graphics. See also Accessibility.
- Spatially organized silhouette-symbols, with hori-Lidar-fx on top.
- To recap: Chess board influence, with Sight Distance and spherical
  perspective.
- Conversely, no numeral scores, button lists or green tiny text inside boxes.

___H

Hexagonal Planet Sphere
  sakasama> Why not use hexagonal tiles on a sphere? They won't be perfect hexagons, but it would be a slight and
  consistent distortion. The hexagonal system is straightforward though when the tiles are clustered as parallelograms;
  merely taking the three axis system, then using only two axis for coordinates since the third is redundant.

History in Planet Sphere
All magnificent power-structures are persisted on planet environment, but "bought" by locale peoples.
- persisted in History Index.


___L

Lost In Transmission #nature #entropy
Most signals Units and Player can receive are subject to natural entropy.
- entropy is calculated from solar simulation.
- This entropy determines if player receives signal, if current sight radius adds signal.


___M

#marketing #publicity #PR
baribal> Oh, and if it's a web game, put it on itch.io, that'll also drive traffic.

Meaning #myth #history #art
Zecurfoez generates history, meaning, and possibly virtual currency.
- Game-play history collected in History Index of the Game Server.
- What other outcomes could a game have?
- How can Zecurfoez become meaningful artistically or socially for players?
- From authoritarian dominance hierarchy power-structure into egalitarian co-experience, resulting in artistic structure?
- Dominant brain micro-tubule frequency from megahertz to terahertz range?

Micromanaging #alert
Aargh no micromanaging! You cannot micromanage anything in real life!
- Units, even followers are autonomous and make their own mind.
- Player only controls their own unit, and can give commands. Laws? Policy?

___O

Open Source
Its better for you

Orange
The main theme color of Zecurfoez game is Zecurfoez orange: a dusty sunset -orange of clouds on the horizon.
- 2400 K color temperature.


___P

Planet Simulation #logic #gamelogic #entropy
- computation to procure realistic natural planetary phenomena of sunshine, rain and earthquakes.
- EPS computes effects from planet simulation.

Power-structure
The home-construct of each unit: a shed, cabin or a magnificent palace. Center point for physical unit and resource interaction. Power structure is the configuration of players game plan, whether it means trumping others structures, or cohesive aligned interaction with others.
- resource flows
- unit policies
- sight and defensive perimeter


Project Equity
All project contributors gain CoCo's (from contribution coins) from their contributions.
- a kind of symbolic sweat equity.
- contribcoins equal votes whenever project direction is discussed? Per quarter?
- If possible, project may later create a way to exchange contribcoins.
- total CoCo's = total commits and merges into Master?
- user CoCo's = total merges into master?


___S

Sector
Divisions of Earth into roughly 300*300 sq-km parcels.
- Default sector is a 30x30 grid of Sub-sectors.
- Sectors receive certain Solar, Meteorological and Natural multipliers.
- properties sampled from Earth geodata.
- amount of solar insolation
- rainfall, storms/ice storms, earthquakes/volcanoes.
- average temperature
- tribes of peoples in sector, as in 2021 Linux language locales /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED + refugee/nomadic peoples for generating history, names and ethnic background for units


Sub-sector
Each Sub-sector has a terrain type (ocean/water, desert, plains, forest, mountain), elevation, fauna, and structure properties. 
- corresponds roughly to a 3 km x 3 km parcel of real land.
- Unit interactions and travel calculations sampled from Sub-sectors.

___T

Terrain Distance Function TDS
- Terrain distance function is cost for Action&traveling in current Sector for each Sub-sector.
- f: elevation *  (temperature celcius degrees from 22 C) * action cost

Triangular Tile on a Polyhedron
  jimbzy> A geodesic polyhedron is probably the easiest way to go and most consistent.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_polyhedron

___U

UI
A spherically "perspective" distorted representation of Earth Sectors.
- N*N grid-representation of the 40x40 sector EPS surface. The grid size N is equal to Commander Sight Distance CSD.
- Player Unit must travel or share view with allied/follower units to see outside base CSD.
- Some units/structures may have distance modifiers.
- Alternative explanation: an isometric view with perspective distortion.

UI Terminal Radar
The local mini-map and mini-state can be printfed. Same entropy as for graphical UI.

Unit
Unit is the basic actionable entity in Zecurfoez.
- Unit Sight Distance.
- Unit Follower Function for determining action this round
. Unit Follower Policy: for commanding units to behave in certain fashion.
- Elevation limit (negative: marine max-depth, positive: Terran Max Elevation)
- origin Power-structure.
- Unit history: procedural recombination of 

Unit Action Cost
Preset cost for different actions units may choose. This corresponds to time action takes. Action cost may be multiplied by TDS or other factors.

Unit Followers, Allied Units #gameplay
- units behave autonomous with distance function logic,
  at set radius Unit Sight Distance.
- units are part of structures: Power-structure., or locale, and behave there.
- one can however send units invitation to commander video meeting  (CVM)
- followers are gained by Charming and Power-structure. magnitude (attraction vector).

Unit Follower Function
- Unit Follower determines action by policy*sight radius*terrain pathfinder cost-function.
- Followers will automatically Charm adjacent units, if its not in attack mode.
- Actions may have maximum cost. If surpassed, pass or next.

Unit Follower Policy #commanding #units
- UFP is 4 setting policy: 
   dominate: unit attacks within 30x30 grid around, charm
   defend: unit attacks in 10x10, charm
   neutral: unit will only defend 3x3 perimeter, no-charm
   hide: run away from borders and units, no-charm.
- Some units may not have all settings.

Unit Sight Distance #fogofwar #ui
- Every commander can only see their location radius of the Planetary Sphere, ~15x15 grid, ie. 2200 km sight radius.
- Unit Sight can be shared between allies. Shared Sight is subject to Basic Universal Force, ie. can be lost in transmission.
