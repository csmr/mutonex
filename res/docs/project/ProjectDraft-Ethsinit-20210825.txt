I'm thinking gaming is something that challenges,
 focuses in a relaxing manner,
 entertains meanwhile,
 maybe even teaches

 generate crypto from the gameplay and then share that between players

The framing story, the gameplay, the simulation

00:41 < circuitbone> The other big aspect, how do you keep adding levels or content without the real labour to keep them intrinsically motivated to hunt more purple derps. The last one to answer is how do you do that without server costs  as well.
00:42 < cAMP> yeah it has to be "open" world, and it has to be "generative" and "fractal", but in a duplicable fashion
00:46 < cAMP> So I'm thinking the game world should imitate planetary physics, and entropy is quite high here, and one will never be a level 239 wizard because physics...
...things like gravity, solar insolation and biospheres, and the logistics of moving on a fractal terrain are an interesting basis inventing gameplay.

Would you play a game because you get 0.1 euro worth of value from 12 minutes?

00:53 < cAMP> Or maybe the game is about building ornament, so would people game competitively in creating art?

- ZECURFOES GAME -
=================


PROJECT DRAFT

SYNOPSIS
Zecurfoez* is Just For Fun Free Open Source (JFF FOS) project to create fun Earth-simulation based multiplayer
strategy game.

Imagine a casual mix between Starcraft and Civilization IV, where user units are autonomous, players
generate eth by playing, and share it once gamesession ends.

Codename is subject to change, initial name chosen for uniqueness.



* Zecurfoez - recursive acronym from "Zero Currency From Open Source Engine Zecurfoez"

____


CONTEXT
An engaging & relaxed game, where by playing it you gain crypto (, and, art? math skills?).

Game pace should be casual. Directed at audience that likes strategy and simulation games, without
micromanagement. Whoever they are?

An exercise in Open Source, software, sosiology and philosophy, open to those who have means to participate.
To underline: GPL or similar licensed bringing efforts of opensource communities into fruition.

The long-term metaphysical project aim is to generate the last game that can be written, TFCG, which will then
simulate our planet, until through resultant dynamics, it will become a self-sustaining, ultimately 
the last computer game that is running (Zecurfoes -> TFCG).
____


BACKGROUND STORY
The game World starts when the creators have created and started Protogame: Big Bang of the game (BBANG!).
No more is known about the creators or what is The Big Bang.

Players session starts in a simulated Earth World with realistic Earth oceans & continents of year 2021.

Planet Simulation Class Engine Docker (SICED) simulates the game instance according to game rules, including
orbital, solar radiation & weather effects, geographic, elevation and biosphere conditions, fauna and
ultimately civilization interactions.

Basic scenario
Game starts with 8 players, with 30s turns, after which next turn starts even if no action was made. Game
lasts until set 12 minute time-limit, or when one player has others Areas. 

Team scenario
Game starts with basic rules, but with 4 vs 4 scenario, 24h turns, and no set time-limit. Here followers 
are controlled per individual player, but the resultiong units and area is under all same-team 
players control.
____


BASIC RULESET (Dominance scenario)
By combining streams of resources and followers from nature & societies, players can gain area and more
influence over the Earth.

Gamesession involves competing for resources, area and followers, in order to run a powerstructure. Players
start with one unit of Society Resource, which will have an unit of Area, and an unit of Powerstructure in the
World.

Area
Area is an simple envelope bordering 1000 sqkm polygonal area of gameworld surface. A grid outlining players area.
Control of area is possible with powerprojection input.

Mineral resources
Connected network of one unit of mineral resources and one unit of followers combine to produce one unit of
geospatial powerprojection.

Natural resources (fauna)
Area produces certain natural resources, which can be enhanced with powerprojection, at cost of one unit 
of powerprojection per extra unit of natural resources.

Society resources
Areas have societies inhabiting them, who take some of the resources. Societies are the NPCs, measured in 
Society units. 
Societies can give follower units, or take follower units. Societies have attitude: they do
not like all actions. Societies that are friendly towards player, give view of their area to player. Fauna actually has invisible society units, generated from areas natural resource
magnitude - the birds and the trees!

Powerstructure
Powerstructure players aim to grow attracts followers and multiplies resources, according to its magnitude.
Magnitude can be calculated with the formula formula: 
squareroot of Area controlled * Solar effects * Society units. As you can see, it is solar-powered.
Powerstructure has area and gives powerprojection bonus in linear proportion to its magnitude.

Aerospace/Ocean resources
- The tactical area element of the gamerules.
Area produces certain aerospace volume 110 km above the area. Controlling this aerospace costs
powerprojection units, and can be controlled by having more units of powerprojection than the competitor.
Controlling aerospace of an area one does not control stops all units of resource production of the 
competitor. Sea and lake sectors function exactly as aerospace resource area, at half the cost, but do not
have mineral resources.

Followers and Units
Each unit has target control responsibility. Followers can be assigned as units on resource and aerospace
control. The units then automatically produce powerprojection and other effects, according to certain rules.

Game World
Gameworld is idealized flattened Earth sphere map, with 2021 shoreline and elevation, 40 Mm polar circumference.
https://earth-info.nga.mil/php/download.php?file=egm-08interpolation

Area unit is 1/1600th of the total World Area of 1.6 GmÂ², in 1000*1000 km squares, in a 40*40 grid. The 
aerospace extends 110 km above and ocean 8 km below. Each Area receives solar and weather effects.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-area_map

Terrain is generated from basic Earth-based data on per-gamesession basis, with equidifficulty algorithm.

Game Client
While the Earth is initially idealized 40*40 grid, the graphical representation is a spherical
surface centered on players Powerstructure(s). The higher the Powerstructure magnitude, the wider the view
that the sphere includes. In other words, areas closest to the Powerstructure are drawn largest, the areas
furthest from players Powerstructure are most distorted by the spherical representation, down to 1/20th
of size at edges.
