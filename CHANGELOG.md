## 2022-11-03

### Added

- Changelog.md


## 2022-08-22 to 2022-10-14

### Changed

- Added concept art.
- Design Document finalized.

### Removed

- Blockchain spec obsoleted: not a good fit for a in-game score board, as 1. clients are known and 2. the game server is the score authority. So instead: a scoreboard on the server.


## 2022-07-21 to 2022-08-04

### Changed

- Project renamed to Mutonex.
- Sector equals geographic coordinates of geodesic World globe. For base arena subdivision, 18x36 might be enough, 10 degree sector.
- Movement cost

### Removed
- Arena subdivision: fixed sectors mapped on World globe is a wack idea. Since the scenario is post-mini-apocalypse and tech-tree doesn't allow fast travel, gameplay should not be based on units traveling a lot of ground. Emphasis on lidar & network capacities, charm ability and social dynamic, plus reducing entropy.
